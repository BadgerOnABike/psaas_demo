## 1. Strategy Document (Workplan)

Document is here: https://github.com/BadgerOnABike/psaas_demo/blob/Developer/workflow_proposal.md


## 2. Release plan

Burn P3 and Prometheus have been playing nicely as of the March beta builds. The goal is to use that platform as a spring board to get an April release out to the public.

## 5. Toolbox meeting between PSaaS and CIFFC

Legalities of the toolbox. "As the CFS begins the implementation in the CWFIF they may be the best bet for the housing of the toolbox." 

What is the teams perspective on the notion of a national toolbox.

Franco: Met with this IT group a few times, they have some powerful IT folks at the top now. They want to understand the history (rational etc) for things like the toolbox. told them they may be going in the wrong direction. A lot of discomfort from the IT group about the amount of work that has been dropped on their laps. 

Brett: I thought the CWFIF process would likely make spurred development very difficult as it would fall into their development cycle. Had a conversation with the CWFIF about building in some data dissemination process and they mentioned it may be difficult to perform rapid changes and confirmation to their process is difficult now as it's not solidified. Develop alongside and aware of the CWFIF without being inside the CWFIF as the SDLC within the CWFIF may limit the capacity of external partners to contribute.
