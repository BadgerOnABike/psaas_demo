# Prometheus Software as a Service

Prometheus Software as a Service (PSaaS) is an implementation of Prometheus: The Canadian Wildfire Simulation Growth Model. Details on this software can be found [here][firegrowthmodel.ca]. The purpose of PSaaS is to replace the current single computer system with a distributable platform agnostic modelling tool.

### Repository Intent

The goal of the repository is to provide a functional example of PSaaS operating with the JavaScript API. The demo focuses on the Dogrib area as a unit test to compare with previous testing. Additionally we intend to show off all possible functionality of the tool within this series of scripts.

### Setup and basic use

* Clone the repo
* cd into the repo
* do npm i
* edit config.json
* run: node PSaaS_Demo.js _Note this is a work in progress_
